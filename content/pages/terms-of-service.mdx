## Introduction and Acceptance

Welcome to Vlook.ai, an AI-powered multimedia creation and editing platform. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, apps, and services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## Description of the Service

Vlook.ai enables you to generate, edit, and enhance images, videos, and audio through natural language. Features may include generation, editing, enhancement, and workflow tools. We may update, add, or remove features at any time.

## Eligibility and Accounts

- You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may use the Service only with consent from a parent or legal guardian.
- You must provide accurate and complete information and keep your account details up to date.
- You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials and all activity under your account.
- If you use the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to use the Service to:

- Upload, generate, or share content that violates intellectual property, privacy, or other rights.
- Create or distribute content that is illegal, harmful, abusive, hateful, violent, or sexually exploitative.
- Harass, threaten, or impersonate others, or engage in fraud or deception.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, copy, scrape, or build competing models or datasets from the Service.
- Bypass safety controls, exceed reasonable usage limits, or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure.

We may refuse to process content, remove content, or suspend accounts that violate these Terms or applicable law.

## User Content and Permissions

You retain ownership of content you upload or submit to the Service ("User Content"). You grant Vlook.ai a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, process, transmit, and display User Content solely to provide, secure, and improve the Service. We may use aggregated and anonymized operational metrics to enhance reliability, performance, and safety. We do not use your prompts, uploads, or outputs to train our models.

You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and permissions to provide User Content and that your use complies with applicable laws.

## AI Outputs and Ownership

Subject to applicable law, you own the outputs generated by the Service from your prompts or inputs. We do not claim ownership of your outputs. Outputs may be similar or identical to content created for other users, and uniqueness is not guaranteed. You are responsible for reviewing outputs for accuracy and compliance with laws, regulations, and third-party rights.

## Fees, Billing, and Credits

We may offer free and paid plans. If you purchase a paid plan, you agree to pay all applicable fees, taxes, and charges in advance in accordance with the plan terms. Subscriptions may auto-renew unless canceled. Failed payments may result in suspension or loss of access.

Some features may use credits or usage limits. Credits may expire and are subject to plan limits or overage charges. Refunds, if any, follow our refund policy or applicable law.

## Availability and Support

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation. Maintenance, outages, and changes may occur. Support levels and response times vary by plan, and documentation may be provided for self-service.

## Third-Party Services

The Service may rely on third-party providers (for example, cloud infrastructure, payment processors, and AI model APIs). Your use of those services may be subject to their terms, and we are not responsible for third-party services or content.

## Termination

You may stop using the Service and close your account at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or pose a risk to the Service, other users, or legal compliance. Upon termination, your access ends immediately. Certain provisions of these Terms survive termination.

## Disclaimers

AI-generated outputs may be inaccurate or incomplete and are provided for informational purposes only. The Service is not professional advice (including legal, medical, financial, or safety advice). Use the Service at your own risk.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Vlook.ai will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Service is limited to the amount you paid to Vlook.ai in the 12 months preceding the claim, or the minimum amount required by law, whichever is greater.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold Vlook.ai harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses arising from your User Content, your use of the Service, or your violation of these Terms.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice via the Service or by email. Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Vlook.ai operates. Disputes will be resolved in the courts of competent jurisdiction unless applicable law provides otherwise.
