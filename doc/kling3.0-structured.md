### Dear Kling AI Creators,

Dear Kling AI Creators,
We are excited to announce a major upgrade to Kling. Building on our previous all-in-one creative engine, the Kling 3.0 Model is powered by a deeply unified training framework, enabling truly native multimodal input and output. By seamlessly integrating Native Audio with advanced Element Consistency control, Kling 3.0 infuses AI-generated visuals with a stronger sense of life and coherence. In addition, the Kling 3.0 Model breaks previous duration limits and introduces intelligent Multi-shot storytelling, further expanding the creative and narrative boundaries of AI-powered video creation.

Building on Kling VIDEO O1 and Kling VIDEO 2.6, the new model integrates multiple tasks — such as Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Reference-to-Video, video content addition and removal, video modification and transformation — into a unified, native multimodal training model. This model not only supports longer video generation (up to 15 seconds), but also offers Native Audio, more flexibility in storyboarding and shot control, and higher accuracy in prompt adherence. Overall image realism is significantly enhanced, with characters' performances becoming more expressive and dynamic. Based on the upgraded unified multimodal approach, Kling VIDEO 2.6 has been upgraded to VIDEO 3.0, while Kling VIDEO O1 has been upgraded to VIDEO 3.0 Omni, bringing a comprehensive evolution in creative control and narrative possibility.

1）VIDEO 3.0

### • Multi-Shot: AI Director Onboard, One-Click Cinematic Output

Let AI help build your scene with more shots and coverage. The all-new Multi-Shot feature is designed to understand scene coverage and shots in your prompt, automatically adjusting camera angles and compositions. From classic shot-reverse-shot dialogues to advanced techniques like cross-cutting dialogue and voice-over, the model understands cinematic languages with precision. No more tedious cutting and editing — just one generation for a cinematic video, making complex audiovisual expressions accessible to all creators.

### • World's First: Image-to-Video + Enhanced Subject Consistency
Leveraging deep multimodal understanding from the underlying model, in addition to normal image-to-video generation, this upgrade supports multi-image references, or even video references as Elements, further anchoring specific elements within the scene. With subject building and referencing, the model locks in the traits of characters, items, and the scene. Regardless of camera movements and scene development, the key subjects remain stable and consistent throughout.

### • Upgraded Native Audio Output with Character Referencing & More Languages

Native Audio is now upgraded for precise referencing of characters and their speaking. In multi-character scenes, you can pinpoint the exact character speaking, eliminating ambiguity and confusion.
Meanwhile, the upgrade now supports more languages (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish) and the rendition of authentic dialects and accents, and even dialogues in different languages in the same scene. Whether it’s a bilingual conversation for work, or daily-life scene with multiple dialects, the lip movements and facial expressions are natural and coherent.

### • Native-Level Text Output with Precise Lettering Capabilities
Whether preserving details like signs and captions from the original image, or generating entirely new text content, the model presents clear lettering in well-structured layouts. This not only enhances the realism in video output, but also meets the need for high-fidelity use cases such as e-commerce advertising.

### • 15-Second Generation: More Creativity per Output

The new model generates up to 15 seconds of continuous video, with flexible duration ranging from 3 to 15 seconds. This is not just about longer output, but unlocking more narrative possibilities — with 15 seconds, the model can comfortably accommodate more complex action sequences and scene development. Whether it's the delicate unfolding of a long shot or the seamless progression of multiple plotlines, everything can be fully presented within a single generation. Say goodbye to fragmented assembly and embrace a story with real progression and flow.

VIDEO O1 supports Element building from multiple images in different angles. In the new 3.0 Omni, when building your Element, you can also upload an audio clip (at least 3s long with speaking) to extract the voice, giving the Elements another dimension for even more lifelike characters in generations.

### • Storyboard Narrative 3.0: Flexible Duration, Customizable Shots, and 15s Preci

• Storyboard Narrative 3.0: Flexible Duration, Customizable Shots, and 15s Precise Control

### In VIDEO O1, you could freely generate videos with durations ranging from 3 to 1

In VIDEO O1, you could freely generate videos with durations ranging from 3 to 10 seconds. In VIDEO 3.0 and 3.0 Omni, we've maintained flexible duration control while introducing native custom storyboard capabilities, increasing the single-generation duration to 15 seconds.
Now, you can have precise control at the shot level, specifying the duration, shot size, perspective, narrative content, and camera movements for each shot, ensuring smooth transitions between scenes.
With just one generation, you can create a well-paced, structured multi-shot narrative, where every second of the video perfectly serves your creative vision.

2) Native Cross-Modal Audio Engine: Building upon existing capabilities, with optimal noise sampling intervals across different modalities, and a new module for audio extraction and embedding, the model is able to output more natural and coherent sound effects, dialogues, and singing performances. Paired with an upgraded end-to-end prompt reference system, it achieves breakthroughs in voice preservation and precise prompt references, enabling deep audio-visual coherence.

### 3) Multimodal Reference and Decoupling Control Solution: The model supports subj

3) Multimodal Reference and Decoupling Control Solution: The model supports subject building based on video reference, and adding specific voices to subjects. By utilizing feature decoupling and recombination technologies, the model allows for adding or editing subjects across difference scenes with complexity and flexibility, ensuring seamless integration of subjects with audio-visual features throughout long video creation.

**Prompt**

Cinematic shot on a European villa's outdoor terrace. A young Caucasian woman in a blue and white striped short-sleeved shirt, khaki shorts with a brown belt, sits barefoot at a table with a blue-and-white checkered tablecloth. Opposite her sits a young Caucasian man in a white T-shirt. The camera slowly pushes in. The woman swirls juice in her glass, gazing at the distant woods, and says, “These trees will turn yellow in a month.” Close-up on the man as he lowers his head and whispers, “But they'll be green again next summer.” The woman then turns her head, smiling at him, and asks, “Are you always this optimistic?” The man looks up into her eyes and replies, “Only about summers with you.” High-quality, 4k, realistic textures, natural sunlight, emotional atmosphere.

### Example 13 - • 15-Second Generation: More Creativity per Output

**Prompt**

Ultra-wide medium-long shot with horizontal tracking opening, low-angle stabilizer movement near the ground, high-contrast romantic cinematic color grading with cold blue night and silvery starry sky, poetic realism and classical epic atmosphere; the subject is a young woman in a dark green long dress running at full speed on moonlit garden grass, skirt billowing in the wind with dynamic curves, holding a small white flower in her right hand and lifting her skirt with her left, breathing heavily with a determined gaze; at the 4-second mark, as she accelerates, several men and women in vintage formal attire enter the frame from both sides, running parallel to her, some try to approach or shout back but no one touches her, suggesting a chase and escape; at the 8-second mark, the camera zooms into a medium shot, pans to the front for tracking and rises slightly, she glances back at a young man as their eyes meet for a moment with emotions surging, then the woman and man hold hands to run together; at the 12-second mark, the music and action reach a climax as the camera stays close to her profile and flying hair while she releases the white flower into the air, which falls in slow motion as the crowd behind passes by; in the final 3 seconds, the camera continues to push forward without stopping as the couple breaks through the crowd and runs toward the starry sky at the end of the garden, their figures gradually occupying the center of the frame; the overall atmosphere is intense, romantic, and resolute, like an explosive narrative of fate, choice, and freedom.
